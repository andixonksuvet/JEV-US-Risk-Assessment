# Background

In order to answer question 50 - What is the probability of infecting a
first local (indigenous) host, given the pathway of entry and the
expected region and time of entry? [1st transmission step] - we assume
introduction of the virus will be through an introduced mosquito by air
or inland/coastal port and therefore want to estimate the density of JEV
hosts (feral pigs, domestic pigs, and *ardeidae* birds) in a 7.7 km
radius, the maximum active flight distance for a *Culex* species[^1], of
inland/coastal ports (called seaports in this document) and airports
that had at least one flight/ship from the region of JEV distribution.

## Location of ports and numbers of ships/flights

See Dixon et al. (doi: TBD) for detailed methods about data sources, but
briefly, flights with an origin in the region of JEV distribution and a
destination in the US were identified from the Bureau of Transportation
(BTS) T-100 Market (all carriers) database for the years 2017-2022[^2].
Airport longitude and latitude was identified as the most extant airport
location from the BTS Master Coordinate file[^3]. Foreign cargo shipping
was identified from US waterway data from the US Army Corp of
Engineers - Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center for the years
2017-2020[^4] (2020 was the most recent year). The number of inbound
ships from a foreign port and containers were collected. Seaport
location was collected from the BTS Principal Port list[^5]. If the port
could not be identified from the list, the location was estimated as the
nearest city.

## Feral pigs

Observations of feral pigs and port information were converted to `sf`
objects. Each feral pig observation was given a buffer of 600 m, which
corresponds to a core area of 1.09 km^2^ for feral pigs[^8], and
determined if it was within 7.7 km of the port location (see
[Background] for rationale).

    Demography, sociospatial behaviour and genetics of feral pigs (Sus
    scrofa) ina semi-arid environment. Journal of Zoology 247(3):
    311-322.

    Franckowiak and Poch√© (2018;
    (<https://doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031-179.1.28>) also report kernal
    density estimates of feral hog core area sizes of 1.16 (+/- 0.95)
    and 1.51 (+/- 0.96) km^2^ for two field sites in Texas.

## Domestic pigs

As we do not have exact location of pig farms, the density of pig
livestock in the county of the port of interest will be used as a proxy
for domestic pig hosts in proximity to the site of introduction. Density
was calculated from hog production from the NASS 2017 Ag census[^9] and
the square kilometer of each county based on the tigris package[^10].

## Summary

### Airports

Information on airports in "Non-disclosed" counties:

-   Washington (53): Moses Lake - 20,000 animals in county (based on
    <https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2017/Online_Resources/Ag_Atlas_Maps/17-M211g.php>)

-   Ohio (39): Columbus - at edge of heavy production

-   Kansas (20): Wichita - amongst counties with moderate production
